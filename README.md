# Online editor for traditional wooden buckets.

With this tool, you can easily create your library of buckets and print out templates for use as
you manually create your wooden bucket using manual tools like in the pre-industry society.

The project is pre-set to use PostgreSql, but to easily get it up and running, uncomment and uncomment the "datasource" related code in prisma/schema.prisma, so you use a local database with "sqlite" instead.
